By creating this repository, I grant permission for everyone to use my code. However, since it is licensed under the GPL, any modifications or distributions must also be open source.

Thank you all for your support over the last few months.

Take a look at other projects like Khan Destroyer. Although it's quite broken, my code might help fix it properly!
